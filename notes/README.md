# MPLS-TE Lab Notes

## Lab Goals
- Understand classic MPLS Traffic Engineering with RSVP-TE
- Compare RSVP-TE with SR-TE from the SR-MPLS lab
- Build foundation for understanding why operators moved to Segment Routing

## Topics Covered
- [x] Phase 1 — IS-IS baseline
- [ ] Phase 2 — LDP label distribution
- [ ] Phase 3 — RSVP-TE basic tunnel with explicit path
- [ ] Phase 4 — CSPF path computation + autoroute
- [ ] Phase 5 — FRR link and node protection
- [ ] Phase 6 — L3VPN over MPLS-TE

## Lab Topology
> Same diamond as SR-MPLS lab: R1(PE) – R2(P) – R4(PE), R1 – R3(P) – R4, R2–R3 cross-link
> CE1 on R1, CE2 on R4
